How to become a good Data Engineer

Prerequisites 
---------------------
1. Programming fundamentals 
2. SQL Basics

You should learn the below things
--------------------------------------
1. Distributed Computing Fundamentals
2. Data Lake Concepts
3. One data ingestion tool
4. DWH concepts 
5. One NOSQL Database (good to know not mandatory)
6. In-memory computation using Apache Spark (pyspark)
7. Structured Streaming with Kafka for real time data
8. One of the Cloud - AWS/Azure/GCP (knowing multi cloud is a add on)
10. Integration of various components
11. One Scheduling/Monitoring tool 
12. CICD for production readiness
13. Do a couple of projects to get a good feel of it.

If you are looking to learn AWS cloud then learn the below technologies

EMR
Redshift
Athena
Glue
S3
Lambda
EC2
stepfunction
sns
sqs
iam

If you are looking to learn Azure then try learning the below

ADLS gen2
Azure Databricks
Azure Data Factory
Synapse

If you are having 8+ years experience then focus on -
Performance Tuning Part & Design Aspects

If you are targeting Top Product based companies then 
Data Structures & Algorithm is also very important.
Arrays, LinkedList & Trees should be good enough.

Just to get confidence check a few mock interviews on my youtube channel and that should be the final level of confidence you need.

Remember, don't just learn to prepare for interviews.
your objective should be to effectively work on projects.

So it's important to focus more on internals & this will be the best way to be interview ready also!

If I am missing anything please feel free to add in comments.

PS~ I follow similar roadmap in my Ultimate Big Data Program. New batch starting tomorrow. DM to know more.
